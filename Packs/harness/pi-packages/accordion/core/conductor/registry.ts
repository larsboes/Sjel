/*
 * registry.ts — the catalog of conductors the live host (`./liveHost`) can attach (Phase C).
 *
 * This is the SINGLE place that enumerates the shipped conductors and the metadata the host needs
 * to attach one: its involvement locks (ADR 0011), its protected-tail target, its wire-departing
 * hold window, and HOW it runs — `in-process` (instantiated inside the extension via `create()`) or
 * `spawn` (an out-of-process runner the extension launches, mirroring the live Truth over the wire).
 *
 * Framework-free and — deliberately — FILESYSTEM-free: `catalogMeta` takes a readiness callback so
 * the extension (which CAN touch disk) resolves each spawn runner and its declared required modules;
 * the registry never reaches for `fs` itself.
 *
 * The lock/tail/hold metadata for the in-process conductors is SOURCED FROM THE CONDUCTOR
 * DEFINITIONS THEMSELVES — each is instantiated once at module load and its declared `locks` /
 * `tailTokens` / `holdWireUpToMs` read off the instance — so the catalog can never drift from what
 * the conductor actually claims. The spawn conductors are the exception: they run out of process,
 * and their classes cannot be imported here without pulling process-only baggage into the
 * extension bundle (thermocline's `child_process` attention-probe; triptych's wasm tree-sitter
 * engine), so their metadata is mirrored verbatim from their class definitions (kept in lockstep
 * by the comments on `THERMOCLINE` / `TRIPTYCH`).
