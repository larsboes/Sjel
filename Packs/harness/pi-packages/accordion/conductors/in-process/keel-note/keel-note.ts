/*
 * keel-note.ts — keel-lite's synchronous budget keeper plus a small, model-written progress note
 * that survives every trim.
 *
 * WHY. keel-lite held its budget in every run of the 2026-09-28 SlopCode bench (0% of turns over),
 * but in one seed the agent stalled: once its oldest turns were folded it lost continuity and
 * started talking about "the previous agent (me)". compaction-naive kept continuity (its summary
 * is the agent's memory) but was over budget on 12–17% of turns, because an async summary lags a
 * step that adds ~15k tokens. keel-note keeps the part that must be synchronous (the trim) exactly
 * as keel-lite does it, and moves the memory into a small note that is refreshed OFF the hot path.
 *
 *   1. COMPOSITION. keel-note wraps an unmodified `KeelLiteConductor`, attached to a thin proxy of
 *      the real host. The proxy changes exactly three things:
 *        - `stats().liveTokens` (and the `liveTokens` carried by events) is reported as
 *          `real + reserve`, where `reserve = max(0, noteMaxTokens − carrierCost)` (the whole cap
 *          while no note is placed). keel-lite therefore plans against a context that already
 *          holds a full-size note, from the first turn on.
 *        - the CARRIER block (below) is reported `held`, so keel-lite never folds, trims or groups
 *          it and never adopts it on a resync.
 *        - `propose` records which blocks each of keel-lite's applied epochs dropped (folded,
 *          replaced or grouped), copying their original text at trim time as the next note input.
 *      Budget enforcement is keel-lite's, unchanged and synchronous: nothing here ever waits on a
 *      model call before trimming.
 *   2. THE NOTE LIVES AT THE TRIM BOUNDARY. A conductor cannot insert blocks and cannot edit a
 *      `user` block (Truth clamps it `not-foldable`), so the note rides on one existing assistant
 *      block. Rewriting a block invalidates the provider's prompt cache from that block on, and
 *      every keel-lite epoch already invalidates it from its first change on. The next epoch
 *      always starts by folding the oldest still-live thinking block outside the tail (rung R1),
 *      so that block is the BOUNDARY, and the carrier is the first usable block after it: an
 *      unsigned `thinking` block (overwritten) or a small (≤ `textCarrierMax`, 150 tokens at the
 *      default cap) live assistant `text` block (the note is appended to its words). A thinking
 *      block sealed by a provider signature (`ViewBlock.signed`: Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI
 *      Responses) is never a carrier, since the rewritten thought would go out under the old
 *      signature; with signed thinking only text blocks carry the note, and with no usable block
 *      at all the note is not placed that epoch (it waits, ready, for the next trim). When no live
 *      thinking is left outside the protected tail (the steady state of the bench sessions, where
 *      every epoch must shed more than the new thinking alone), the next epoch starts in what
 *      leaves the tail next, so the carrier is the last usable block before the tail. The
 *      note lands as a non-recoverable `replace`, verbatim (no `{#code FOLDED}` handle), capped at
 *      `noteMaxTokens` including block overhead. What it overwrites is copied into the next note
 *      update's input, like any trimmed block.
 *   3. EVERY TRIM MOVES THE NOTE, in the same request as the trim. Right after each applied
 *      keel-lite epoch, one transaction places the note on the new boundary carrier (the finished
 *      note if one is waiting, else the current text unchanged) and releases the old carrier: a
 *      thinking carrier is folded (what the trim does to its neighbours), a text carrier gets its
 *      own words back. The old carrier sat past the point where this epoch started, and the new
 *      one sits past where the next will start, so neither write re-bills anything the trims do
 *      not already re-bill. A finished note never lands on its own: it waits for the next trim. At
 *      a turn boundary the note is only re-placed if it dropped out of context (a human took the
 *      carrier, or a resync lost the substitution), so it is never missing for a request.
 *   4. NOTE CALLS are batched. Each applied keel-lite epoch copies the blocks it dropped into a
 *      pending buffer (each block clipped head+tail, sent to the note model once). A call starts
 *      once the buffer holds `minDroppedTokens`, or as soon as it is full (it keeps only the
 *      newest `spanMaxTokens`, so waiting longer would only discard more). A fallback also calls
 *      after `fallbackTurns` turns with no call, topping the buffer up with the newest blocks the
 *      note has not seen. While a call is in flight, new spans accumulate and one follow-up call
 *      is chained when it lands, if the buffer has reached the threshold again.
 *   5. THE UPDATE CALL goes through `host.complete` (the live session's model and route, logged by
 *      the extension's completion-usage log). Its input is the newest note plus the dropped
 *      span(s), framed as the agent's OWN earlier turns; the output is five terse first-person
 *      sections under a fixed header. A failed or timed-out call keeps the old note and puts its
 *      spans back in the buffer for the next trigger. The agent loop never waits for a note.
 *
 * BUDGET. `real + reserve` = (everything but the carrier) + `noteMaxTokens`, whichever block the
 * note is on, so a placement never moves keel-lite's number except through the two blocks that
 * change hands: it rises by (released old carrier) − (new carrier before the note), at most one
 * thinking digest or one small text block (≤ 150 tokens), and falls when the note overwrites a
 * large thinking block. keel-lite re-reads the true number on its next evaluation.
